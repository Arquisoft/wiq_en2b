== Introduction and Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****
RTVE has hired the company HappySw, composed of students from the Oviedo School of Software Engineering, to develop a new experimental version of the quiz show Saber y Ganar. This application will be called WIQ, where users will be able to register and log in to play. The application will consist of answering questions of different types generated with Wikidata. For each question answered correctly, points will be obtained.

=== Requirements Overview

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

|Goal|Description
| Functional suitability | The system must fulfill its intended purpose effectively and efficiently, allowing users to register, log in, play the quiz, and access their historical data.
| Security | The system must prioritize user data security. It must implement robust authentication mechanisms for user registration and login. The API access points for user information and generated questions must be secured with proper authorization. 
| Reliability | The system should be reliable in generating questions from Wikidata, ensuring that questions are accurate and diverse. The system must handle user registrations, logins, and game data storage without errors.
| Availability | The system must be available 99.99% of the time a user tries to access it.
| Maintainability | The system must be designed and implemented in a way that facilitates easy maintenance and updates.
| Performance efficiency | The system must deliver optimal performance, ensuring responsive interactions for users. The automatic generation of questions from Wikidata and the real-time gameplay must be efficient. The system must handle 20 concurrent users.
| Usability | The system must provide a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to register, log in, and play the game. The system learning time for a user should be less than 4 hours.
| Compatibility | The system must be compatible with various web browsers and devices, ensuring a seamless experience for users regardless of their choice of platform. It has to be well-optimized for different screen sizes and functionalities.
| Transferability | The system must allow for easy transfer of user data and game-related information through its APIs.

=== Stakeholders

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
