|Offers a powerful combination of performance, flexibility, and developer experience, making it a popular choice for building modern web applications. One of the members of the group has already worked with it in the past. It allows us to build a good user interface for the application.

|SpringBoot
|This choice is based on the extensive experience accumulated by our team in developing with Java, as well as the familiarity and comfort offered by the tools and practices associated with the Spring Boot ecosystem.

|PostgreSQL
|We have chosen to use the PostgreSQL database instead of MongoDB due to the relational nature of PostgreSQL, which offers a robust and coherent structure for storing and relating data. We made this decision to ensure data integrity, perform complex queries, and maintain consistency in our storage operations.

|React Libraries
|To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our development process, we've taken proactive steps to incorporate specific libraries into our project. These carefully chosen libraries, meticulously outlined in detail within issue #16.
