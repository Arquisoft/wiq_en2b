== Quality Requirements
=== Quality Tree
This quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements. The Quality tree uses "quality" as a root while the rest of the quality categories will be displayed as branches.

=== Quality Scenarios
To obtain a measurable system response to stimulus corresponding to the various quality branches outlined in the mindmap, we will use quality scenarios. Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

==== Implementation

===== Performance efficiency
The tests were done with a 2 core and 4 GB of memory system.
This system's efficiency has been measured with Gatling. For the script that we used, a user already created, logged in and played a full game. After that, the user clicked to look the statistics.
The scripts were run a total of 4 times. One with 1 user, other with 100 users, another one with 1000 users and finally one with 10000 users.
The results of this scripts show that response times are reasonable up until 1000 users. Having 10000 users playing a game at the same time make a lot of failures.
Here are the results.

**1 user:**

**100 users:**

**1000 users:**

**10000 users:**

===== Security
The system is secured using Spring Security. The user data is stored in a database and the passwords are hashed using BCrypt. The API access points are secured with proper authorization. HTTPS is used to encrypt the data in transit.

The system is also protected against SQL injection via using JPA repositories and prepared statements.

The system is also designed in such a way that prevents cheating, by limiting the options available for the user and doing all validation in the backend, such as checking if the answer is correct, preventing request forgery.

===== Testability

===== Monitoring
The system is monitored using Spring Boot Actuator and Prometheus. The monitoring data is visualized using Grafana.

The actuator is deployed in https://kiwiq.run.place:8443/actuator/prometheus.

The Prometheus server is deployed in http://20.199.84.5:9090.

The Grafana is deployed in http://20.199.84.5:9091. The Grafana dashboard is available at the following link with user asw@uniovi.es and password aswgrafana.

The dashboard used is: https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/6756-spring-boot-statistics/
Make sure to put kiwiq.run.place:8443 as the Instance and WIQ API as the application.

===== Maintainability
In our CodeScene analysis we find that our knowledge distribution is well-balanced as well as a nice code health, excepting one hotspot on a test that is not relevant.
