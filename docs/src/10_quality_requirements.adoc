== Quality Requirements
=== Quality Tree
This quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements. The Quality tree uses "quality" as a root while the rest of the quality categories will be displayed as branches.

=== Quality Scenarios
To obtain a measurable system response to stimulus corresponding to the various quality branches outlined in the mindmap, we will use quality scenarios. Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

==== Usage Scenarios
[options="header",cols="1,3,1"]
|===
|Quality attribute|Scenario|Priority
| Functional suitability | Users shall be able to register, log in, play the quiz, and access historical data without encountering errors or glitches. | High, Medium
| Reliability | The system shall reliably generate accurate and diverse questions from Wikidata. User registrations, logins, and game data storage shall be handled without errors. | High, Medium
| Availability | The system shall be available 99% of the time when a user attempts to access it. | High, High
| Performance efficiency | The system shall deliver optimal performance, ensuring responsive interactions for users. It shall efficiently generate questions from Wikidata and handle real-time gameplay with up to 1000 concurrent users. | High, High
| Usability | The system shall provide a user-friendly interface, allowing users to register, log in, and play the game with a learning time of less than 15 minutes. Other functionalities that are not that obvious, such us rules or about pages, are allowed for 2 hours. | High, Medium
| Security | User data shall be securely handled. Robust authentication mechanisms shall be in place for user registration and login. API access points for user information and generated questions shall be secured with proper authorization. | Medium, High 
| Compatibility | The system shall be compatible with various web browsers and devices, providing a seamless experience for users regardless of their choice of platform. It shall be well-optimized for different screen sizes and functionalities. | High, Medium

==== Implementation
===== Security
The system is secured using Spring Security. The user data is stored in a database and the passwords are hashed using BCrypt. The API access points are secured with proper authorization. HTTPS is used to encrypt the data in transit.

The system is also protected against SQL injection via using JPA repositories and prepared statements.

The system is also designed in such a way that prevents cheating, by limiting the options available for the user and doing all validation in the backend, such as checking if the answer is correct, preventing request forgery.

===== Testability
Many different tests were done to this project as they were considered as a critical requirement for the development.

* **Unit tests:** The strongest constraint, as an 80% code coverage is mandatory to ensure code works properly.

* **Load tests:** They show how the system will behave under expected workloads.

* **Stress tests:** This way we can the behaviour of the system under unexpected loads, such as DDoS attacks. Although we are not protected against them yet, we could do it by using CloudFare as discussed issue #266.

* **Acceptance (e2e) tests:** The idea behind them is to ensure the correct functionality of the whole system so real user interactions will work as expected.

* **Usability tests:** They aim for the idea of knowing how easy the product is to learn and to use.

More information about testing can be seen in Section 12.

===== Monitoring
The system is monitored using Spring Boot Actuator and Prometheus. The monitoring data is visualized using Grafana.

The actuator is deployed in https://kiwiq.run.place:8443/actuator/prometheus.

The Prometheus server is deployed in http://20.199.84.5:9090.

The Grafana is deployed in http://20.199.84.5:9091. The Grafana dashboard is available at the following link with user asw@uniovi.es and password aswgrafana.

The dashboard used is: https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/6756-spring-boot-statistics/
Make sure to put kiwiq.run.place:8443 as the Instance and WIQ API as the application.

===== Maintainability
In our CodeScene analysis we find that our knowledge distribution is well-balanced as well as a nice code health, excepting one hotspot on a test that is not relevant.
