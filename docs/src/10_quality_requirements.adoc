== Quality Requirements
=== Quality Tree
This quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements. The Quality tree uses "quality" as a root while the rest of the quality categories will be displayed as branches.

=== Quality Scenarios
To obtain a measurable system response to stimulus corresponding to the various quality branches outlined in the mindmap, we will use quality scenarios. Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.
