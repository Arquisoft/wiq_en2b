This is a base repo for the [Software Architecture course](http://arquisoft.github.io/) in [2023/2024 edition](https://arquisoft.github.io/course2324.html). 

This repo is a basic application composed of several components.

Component | Route | Description
-- | -- | --
Backend/API | `api/` | The main backend service, implemented in Java SpringBoot. It serves all requests from the frontend, and it doubles as main API. It also has a JWT-based authentication system.
Question generator | `questiongenerator/` | A SpringBoot-based service, ran alongside the main backend service, that generates questions and inserts them into the database
Webapp | `webapp/` | Our own frontend to the backend. It is implemented in React 18.
    
***

- **Question generatior**. Express service that is exposed to the public and serves as a proxy to the two previous ones.
- **User service**. Express service that handles the insertion of new users in the system.
- **Auth service**. Express service that handles the authentication of users.
- **Webapp**. 

Both the user and auth service share a Mongo database that is accessed with mongoose.
