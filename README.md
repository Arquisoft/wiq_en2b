This is a repository for the [Software Architecture course](http://arquisoft.github.io/) in [2023/2024 edition](https://arquisoft.github.io/course2324.html).

This repo is a basic application composed of several components.

Component | Route | Description
-- | -- | --
Backend/API | `api/` | The main backend service, implemented in Java SpringBoot. It serves all requests from the frontend, and it doubles as main API. It also has a JWT-based authentication system.
Question generator | `questiongenerator/` | A Java program that generates questions and inserts them into the database, from where they are fetched by the API.
Webapp | `webapp/` | Our own frontend to the backend. It is implemented in React 18.
    
***

Both the backend/API and the question generator use PostgreSQL.
